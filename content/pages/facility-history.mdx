      ## Facility History


      Since 1960, the College of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS)
      at Oregon State University (OSU) has maintained an active program in
      Marine Geology, and CEOAS continues to be one of the leading oceanographic
      institutions involved in exploration, research and the collection of
      marine samples. To preserve these materials for future research, Drs. Ted
      C. Moore and LaVerne Kulm in 1971 established the OSU Core Lab, now known
      as the OSU Marine and Geology Repository.


      The facility began receiving support by the U.S. National Science
      Foundation (NSF) in 1972 when the laboratory relocated to a building with
      4,800 cubic feet (CFT) of refrigerated space for core storage. The OSU
      Marine and Geology Repository has been funded continuously since 1976 as a
      national NSF community facility with a mission to archive and distribute
      geological samples for scientific research and education.

      In 1986, Drs. Alan C. Mix and Martin Fisk assumed management of the
      facility and since that time the OSU Marine and Geology Repository has
      undergone several phases of expansion and remodeling. Following the 1990
      expansion of refrigerated space, the sediment core collection of the
      University of Washington was incorporated, and the name changed from the
      OSU Core Laboratory to the OSU/NORCOR Marine Geology Repository. In 1994,
      a second major expansion of the facility was completed. The refrigerated
      space was increased to 30,000 CFT. At that time a laboratory for core
      description and sample handling was added. In 1995, the first repository
      web page was launched. In 2002, the rock storage facility was renovated,
      adding another 5,500 CFT of shelved, interior rock storage and additional
      covered exterior staging space. In 2003, the facility was renamed the
      OSU/COAS Marine Geology Repository.


      Dr. David Christie replaced Dr. Fisk in 2003 as curator of the rock
      collection and sampling activities and in 2006 Dr. Christie was replaced
      by Dr. Robert Duncan. At the end of 2005, Dr. Nicklas Pisias replaced Dr.
      Mix as the curator responsible for oversight of the sediment core and trap
      sample collections. This transition established a closer link between the
      OSU Marine Geology Repository and the OSU Marine Coring Facility (Dr.
      Pisias, PI) that supports US scientists needing coring expertise aboard
      UNOLS vessels including the R/V Oceanus, R/V Melville, R/V Revelle, R/V
      Kilo Moana, R/V Langseth and the USCG icebreaker Healy. The collaboration
      in particular facilitated the collection of shipboard physical properties
      data using the containerized multi-sensor track owned by the OSU Marine
      Geology Repository.


      Dr. Stoner and Dr. Koppers replaced Drs. Pisias and Duncan in 2010. In
      2009 refrigerated space was increased to a total of 41,000 CFT and in 2010
      a -11Â°F, 1,100 CFT freezer was installed for frozen storage of gas hydrate
      bearing samples donated by the Department of Energy-National Energy and
      Technology Laboratory (DOE-NETL). In October 2011 COAS merged with the OSU
      Department of Geosciences to become the new, expanded College of Earth,
      Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS). At that time, the repository was
      renamed the OSU Marine and Geology Repository.
