      # Instrumentation Setup


      Our laboratory is equipped with two noble gas mass spectrometers for
      carrying out <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar age
      determinations. We have two [Thermo Scientific ARGUS
      VI](/instruments/#ARGUS-VI) multi-collector mass spectrometers with five
      fixed Faraday detectors and one ion-counting CuBe electron multiplier.

      ## <Anchor value="Argus" />ARGUS VI Multi-collector Mass Spectrometers


      Our two instruments are [Thermo Scientific Model ARGUS
      VI](/instruments/#ARGUS-VI) multi-collector mass spectrometers with five
      fixed Faraday detectors (including amplifier circuits with 10<Superscript
      value="13" /> Ohm resistors) and one ion-counting CuBe electron multiplier
      mounted next to the low mass 36 Faraday detector. These systems are
      equipped with a 30 W Synrad Firestar v30 CO2 laser with industrial scan
      head for carrying out gas extractions. The ARGUS VI can be operated in
      three different modes:


      * **Multi-collector Mode** to simultaneously collect all masses m/e = 36,
      37, 38, 39 and 40 on the 10<Superscript value="12" /> Ohm Faraday
      collector array for samples providing sufficient amounts of gas for
      analyses

      * **Peak-switching Ion-counting Mode** using the CuBe electron multiplier
      for high-precision analyses on (very) small gas fractions

      * **Combination Mode** whereby all masses will be measured simultaneously
      in a multi-collector mode, but with mass m/e = 36 aimed on the CuBe
      electron multiplier and masses m/e = 37, 38, 39 and 40 on the adjacent
      Faraday cups


      The latter configuration provides the advantages of running in a full
      multi-collector mode while measuring the lowest peak (on mass 36) on the
      highly sensitive electron multiplier. Even though the ARGUS VI has a
      fixed-position collector array, an electronic steering plate placed before
      every collector allows for nudging over the beams to fall exactly in the
      middle of all five collectors. In addition, in both multi-collector
      Faraday modes we would have the option to use 10<Superscript value="11" />
      Ohm resistors with a very low baseline noise of \~2×10<Superscript
      value="-17" /> A or higher 10<Superscript value="13" /> Ohm resistors that
      are more sensitive, when these come on the market.

      ## Customized NG Prep System Extraction Lines


      The custom-made extraction lines feature two laser chambers, an open port
      for later attachment of a low-volume resistance furnace with an automated
      sample carousel, three SAES getters, and two air pipette systems (one for
      air and one for an 38Ar spiked air standard).

      ## ARGUS-VI-F (low volume)


      The ARGUS VI is connected to an all-metal extraction system for
      <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar age
      determinations. It has an overall lower volume (\~500 cc) than our MAP
      215-50 system but we use a similar set of getters for cleaning up the
      reactive gasses with one SAES ST-101 Zr-Al getter (450 °C) and two SAES
      ST-172 Zr-V-Fe getters (21 °C and 250 °C). Beside its lower volume, the
      design of the CO2 laser system is also different by using an industrial
      Synrad XY scan head for steering the laser beam during sample heating.
      This allows us to carry out the sample heating by setting up a beam raster
      pattern while keeping the sample housing stationary. Using this novel
      technique we can produce a laser beam that can move continuously up and
      down at speeds up to 300 in/s and that results in an even heating of the
      entire sample being analyzed, a prerequisite for carrying out first-rate
      incremental heating experiments. This laser system will be equipped with
      an air-cooled Synrad 25W CO2 laser that has a maximum laser power
      sufficient for the fusion of single crystals and flux monitors.

      ## ARGUS-VI-G (increased getter capacity)


      Our second ARGUS-VI is setup to to have increased getter capacity in order
      to handle samples such as submarine basalts that potentially contain more
      alteration products.


      This extraction line uses a set of 2 GP50 Zr-Al

      getters operating at 450°C and 2 AP10 Zr-Al getters at room temperature
      (21°C).
