      ## Our mission is to facilitate research, education, and the advancement
      of scientific knowledge through access and preservation of our diverse
      collection of rock, lake, and marine sediment samples from around the
      world and pole to pole.

          At OSU-MGR we distribute thousands of sediment and hard rock samples
          on an annual basis to researchers all over the world. As an
          NSF-OCE-MGG funded facility, the OSU-MGR (and therefore PI’s who
          curate their samples) is bound by the NSF-OCE data policy for NSF-OCE
          funded projects. Samples from cores and rocks, information on sampling
          stations, and descriptions of materials from the OSU collection are
          provided to qualified scientific investigators upon receipt of
          well-documented requests. Materials for educational purposes and
          museum displays may also be available in limited quantities.

          The collection includes more than 24 miles of oceanic sediment cores
          and tens of thousands of marine rock specimens that provide scientists
          an archive of Earth’s history, including changes in climate, biology,
          volcanic and seismic activity, meteorite interactions and more. In
          2017, the university was awarded stewardship of the cores of the
          Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility, which had been housed at
          Florida State University, by the National Science Foundation. The
          Florida State collection was transferred to Oregon State via 14
          50-foot refrigerated semi-trucks over the summer of 2018.

          The OSU-MGR is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded repository
          that hosts the OSU Marine Geology and Geophysics collection and the
          Antarctic Core Collection. OSU moved its existing collection from
          storage on campus to the new 33,000 ft² facility that includes 10,900
          ft² of refrigerated core storage, 11,600 ft² of dry rock storage and a
          550 ft² walk-in freezer. The facility is well-equipped to run major
          sampling parties, research programs, and educational endeavors.
          Laboratory space is available for analytical activities including
          scanning tracks for physical properties and elemental analyses.

      ## Education and Outreach


      Outreach is an important part of what we do at the OSU-MGR. Our
      collections cover time periods ranging from sediment deposited on the
      ocean floor in the last few years to sediments that are millions of years
      old, giving students the opportunity to learn about ocean processes
      occurring in different places and over multiple time scales. Please see
      our education and outreach pages for information about in-person and
      virtual tours as well as videos and activities to learn more about cores
      and coring.
