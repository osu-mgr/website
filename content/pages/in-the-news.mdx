      ## Research Projects


      On this page we are providing an overview of the variety of projects we
      are currently working on. Below that we also give a summary of the larger
      projects we carried about with our students and post-docs over the last 30
      years.


      ### Current Projects


      * Integrated Ocean Drilling Program cores from the Louisville seamount
      trail, IODP Expedition 330 on the D/V JOIDES Resolution

      * Integrated Ocean Drilling Program cores from the Shatsky Rise oceanic
      plateau, IODP Expedition 324 on the D/V JOIDES Resolution

      * Dredged rocks from the Walvis Ridge seamounts, Expedition MV1203 on the
      R/V Melville

      * Dredged rocks from the Rurutu hotspot in the Tuvalu seamounts,
      Expedition scheduled for the Summer of 2013 on the R/V Revelle

      * Dredged rocks and land samples from the Marquesas Islands

      * Land samples from the Caribbean large igneous province at Curacao
      Island, Lesser Antilles

      * Acid-leaching effects on 40Ar/39Ar groundmass age dating


      ### Geochronology of Volcanic Rocks from the Worldâ€™s Ocean Basins

      lunar impact glasses returned by the Apollo 16 mission


      ### Geochronology of Ash Layers in Marine Sediments


      * Eocene-Oligocene boundary and Pacific NW flora assemblages

      * Pliocene-Miocene sections from ODP Legs 185 and 191


      ### Geochronology of Terrestrial Sediments


      * Total fusion ages for feldspar grains from glacial tills

      * Clay formation ages to identify river drainages contributing to Pacific
      NW margin sediments on glacial-interglacial timescales


      ### Geochronology of Mineralization and Ore Formation in Economic Ore
      Deposits
