      ## Getting Here


      ### *Please use the address below as Google Maps does not always provide
      the correct location.*


      ### Address


      4700 SW Research Way\

      Corvallis, OR 97333


      ### Entrance


      Entrance to the OSU-MGR is on the west side of the building (facing the
      Oregon State Credit Union). The entrance is shared with OSU Printing and
      Mailing. The lobby for the repository is to the right as you enter.


      ### Parking


      The OSU-MGR is located 1.5 miles southwest of the main OSU campus. There
      is ample parking on the west side of the building. The first parking lot
      is reserved for OSU Printing and Mailing Services. Feel free to park
      anywhere else in the second parking lot. Parking is free and does not
      require a campus parking permit.


      ### Biking


      A bike path goes along Philomath Blvd and SW 35th St, cuts over to Bruce
      Starker Arts Park and then up to SW Research Way. Nice ride, 10-15 mins
      from campus.


      ### Bus


      Two Corvallis Transit bus routes travel from downtown or campus to SW
      Research (20-25 minutes):

      [Route 8](https://www.corvallisoregon.gov/cts/page/cts-route-8)
