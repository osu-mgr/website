      # 1. INTRODUCTION<Anchor value="introduction" />


      We are the Marine and Geology Repository, a research facility of Oregon
      State University (OSU-MGR) that supports Earth, Ocean, and Antarctic
      sciences. In our facility we host geological collections acquired since
      the 1960's of sediment and rock cores, dredge and ROV samples. We provide
      advanced instrumentation for analyses of these materials.


      These collections are made accessible to the U.S. community and beyond and
      have grown through the years from major additions and collections of
      opportunity from research funded through other resources and donated to
      the repository to support our mission. These programs include Marine
      Geology and Geophysics and Polar Programs at NSF, NOAA, DOE-NETL, USGS,
      and DOGAMI. Additionally, we serve OSU and CEOAS researchers as well as
      the wider research community by providing sample storage and research
      facilities with the understanding that these materials will be donated to
      the facility for curation and subsample distribution after a moratorium
      period.


      As stewards of these invaluable collections we curate using best practices
      and distribute samples upon request to all qualified users for research
      and/or education. Our goal is to make the collections more accessible and
      discoverable, both physically and digitally. This document is designed to
      clarify the policies regarding the diverse activities within our facility
      and curation of the collections to support the scientific community now
      and in the future.


      ***


      # 2. MISSION<Anchor value="mission" />


      Our mission is to facilitate research, education, and the advancement of
      scientific knowledge through access and preservation of our diverse
      collection of rock, lake, and marine sediment samples from around the
      world's oceans, including the Arctic and the Southern Oceans.


      ***


      # 3. PURPOSE<Anchor value="purpose" />


      The purpose of the repository is to curate our collections and associated
      datasets in order to facilitate modern science and research. To do this we
      work to:


      * **expand** and **preserve** the collections using best practices for
      future research and education.

      * **distribute** geological subsamples from our collections for future
      research and education.

      * **promote** access to our diverse collections via our outreach program
      and state-of-the-art web and data services.


      ***


      # 4. SCOPE OF COLLECTIONS<Anchor value="scope" />


      Several collections of geological samples from around the world are housed
      at OSU-MGR. Most collections are made up of samples taken during research
      cruises. While ocean sediment samples and rocks are a focus of our
      collections, we also house terrestrial core samples and hand samples from
      various field campaigns. The five major collections of the OSU-MGR are
      listed below:


      * **Marine Geology & Geophysics Collection:** Marine sediment cores and
      rocks collected on research cruises funded by NSF Marine Geology &
      Geophysics. This global collection was initiated in the 1960's, and
      includes the Marine Geology collection donated from the University of
      Washington.

      * **Antarctic Core Collection:** Geological samples collected in and
      around the Southern Ocean funded by NSF Polar Programs since the 1960's.
      The collection includes marine sediment as well as rock drill cores,
      collected on research cruises or from the ice of Antarctica.

      * **NOAA hosted Marine Rock Collection:** This collection is comprised of
      seafloor rocks collected from NOAA research cruise dredging as well as ROV
      dive samples from the Ocean Explorer Program.

      * **Oregon Drill Core Collection:** rock cores via diamond drilling
      collected around the state of Oregon, donated to the OSU-MGR from DOGAMI
      and other private donors.

      * **Research Collections** : These geological samples are collected by
      Principal Investigators for active research projects. These samples also
      serve as a permanent record for these research activities for cases in
      which no other appropriate repository currently exists.


      ***


      # 5. CODE OF CONDUCT<Anchor value="code" />


      OSU-MGR follows the Oregon State University [Code of
      Ethics](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/sites/leadership.oregonstate.edu/files/190118_adopted_university_code_of_ethics.pdf).


      ***


      # 6. ACCESSION POLICY<Anchor value="accession" />


      Acquiring new samples to the collections is central to the role of the
      OSU-MGR. Potential donations must be evaluated by OSU-MGR staff. If the
      samples meet the repository's standard criteria, they will be formally
      accessioned into the OSU-MGR collections. The criteria used in evaluating
      a potential acquisition include:


      * Do these specimens align with the OSU-MGR mission, purpose, and scope of
      collections?

      * Is the repository able to properly curate (document, store, preserve,
      share) the samples?

      * Do the samples contain the necessary and accurate metadata (identifiers,
      geospatial information, sample lengths and depths, date of collection)?

      * Does the sample require special care (e.g. toxic, harmful, hazardous,
      unique temperature/humidity)? Is the repository capable of providing those
      resources?


      **6.1 Donor Responsibilities**


      Donors must fulfill all requirements by providing clear and structured
      data in relation to the samples submitted to the repository. These
      obligations provide essential information that allows the facility to
      adequately provide services and samples for years to come.


      * Each sample must be clearly labeled with an identifier that matches with
      listed identifiers in submitted metadata. Samples will be renamed per the
      repository nomenclature.

      * Samples cannot enter the facility until the metadata has been reviewed
      by OSU-MGR staff. A metadata sheet can be downloaded from the OSU-MGR
      website. Basic metadata includes: identifiers, geospatial information,
      sample lengths and depths, date of collection

      * Copies of any and all ancillary data (e.g. descriptions, photos, MST,
      photomicrographs, CT scan data, XRF data) associated with the set of
      samples, including pdfs of relevant publications, should be submitted with
      the request for accession, including storage history whenever possible.

      * The repository requests that thin sections associated with rock sample
      donations are also transferred to OSU-MGR.

      * In the event that the donor has assigned IGSNs to the samples in
      advance, the donor must transfer ownership of those identifiers to
      OSU-MGR.

      * The repository only accepts processed samples on a case-by-case basis
      upon review of the curators.

      * Copies of all permits associated with a sample collection must be
      submitted to OSU-MGR; in cases where appropriate permits will be
      transferred to OSU-MGR.

      * Tracer analyses conducted concurrently with sample processing must be
      disclosed to the repository at the initial point of contact. Samples must
      be swabbed for radiocarbon contamination, and official laboratory results
      must be submitted to the repository prior to shipment to Corvallis.
      Shipments of samples without laboratory results will be refused, as they
      present a threat to the integrity of all OSU-MGR collections.


      At all times the OSU-MGR reserves the right to refuse to acquire any set
      of samples, if the samples have not been processed accordingly and are
      incompletely documented. The submitted metadata form must be approved by
      repository staff before samples can be delivered. Staff may partially
      approve of a list of samples proposed for accession (e.g. remove
      duplicates, remove samples because of missing or poor metadata,
      availability of associated datasets, amount of space per researcher). In
      addition, rock and sediment samples that are too large or too heavy will
      be subsampled by the OSU-MGR.


      Once approved for accession, the samples will be formally transferred into
      the OSU-MGR collections. These collections will be curated in perpetuity,
      and as such will be made findable and accessible per the mission of the
      repository. OSU will register the samples with the System for Earth Sample
      Registration ([SESAR](http://www.geosamples.org/)) in order to acquire an
      International Geo Sample Number ([IGSN](https://www.igsn.org/), a globally
      unique and persistent identifier) for each sample.


      ***


      # 7. DEACCESSION POLICY<Anchor value="deaccession" />


      Deaccession will remove a sample physically from the inventory of the
      OSU-MGR repository. Following deaccession, samples will be disposed of by
      appropriate means. Disposal may consist of transfer to a more appropriate
      repository, removing the sample(s) from the main research collections to
      outreach collection status, or donation to teaching collections. A record
      of the deaccession will be made in the database. The criteria used in
      evaluating a potential deaccession include:


      * Is the sample relevant to the OSU-MGR's mission and purpose?

      * Is there enough data available to make the sample useful to the
      community?

      * Does the sample require special care (e.g. toxic, harmful, hazardous,
      unique temperature/humidity)? Is the repository capable of providing those
      resources?

      * Has the sample deteriorated beyond usefulness?

      * Does the item duplicate other objects in the collection?

      * Do the duties required for curating the sample place an unreasonable
      burden on OSU-MGR staff and/or budget resources?

      * Was the sample initially collected with federal or state funding?


      ***


      # 8. STORAGE CONDITIONS<Anchor value="storage" />


      There are three main storage areas within the repository, each with its
      own set of storage conditions appropriate for preservation of specific
      sample types. In all cases, the facility includes a backup generator,
      temperature monitoring, and alarm systems.


      **Dry/Rock Storage Areas:** These areas are subject to ambient storage
      conditions of the Research Way Building. The temperature is not tightly
      constrained and will vary with the temperature and humidity conditions of
      Corvallis, Oregon throughout the year. The rock drill core, rock samples,
      and dry sediment cores are stored in this area.


      **Cold Room:** This is the storage area for the repository's sediment core
      collections. The room maintains a temperature of 36-40°F. These conditions
      are appropriate for the preservation of sediment cores such that they will
      not freeze nor desiccate, and will slow any growth of mold.


      **Freezer:** This storage area maintains a constant -19°F/-25°C. This
      storage area is appropriate for samples that must remain frozen, such as
      permafrost cores.


      ***


      # 9. SAMPLE REQUESTS<Anchor value="requests" />


      The OSU-MGR sample request policies and procedures ensure that sample
      records, data, and publications are all preserved such that the repository
      will be able to generate access for all collections in perpetuity to serve
      the research community.


      As an NSF/NOAA/OSU funded facility, the OSU-MGR (and therefore PI's who
      curate their samples) follows [Sample and Data
      Policies](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/geo-data-policies/index.jsp). Sample and
      data requests from our collections are provided to qualified scientific
      investigators upon receipt of well-documented requests. Materials for
      educational purposes and museum displays may also be available in limited
      quantities.


      Initial requests should be considered a survey to determine if more
      samples will be required later. Large requests may require more
      justification. Subsequent sample requests during the same investigation
      should include an additional statement describing progress of the study
      and stating the need for additional material. Student requests should be
      submitted through their academic advisor.


      ***


      # 10. SUBMISSION DOCUMENTS<Anchor value="submission" />


      We require that requestors submit two documents with their sample request:


      1. **Initial Statement of Proposed Research**\
         Investigators should submit a letter (PDF format) to request samples. This letter should include a short outline of the intended studies, detailed methods, research objectives, and names and addresses of collaborating investigators. Given that many samples in the collection are irreplaceable, it is requested that special attention is given to the rationale of what to sample, how much, how many samples, and in some cases, the return of unused materials. Please review all images and descriptions prior to requesting samples. Maximum two pages. The statement must include a two-page CV or NSF-style biosketch for the PI and/or students and other scientists, if applicable.
      2. **Sample Request Sheet**\
         The sample request sheet is required for a successful request, as it provides the repository with the necessary context for properly documenting a sampling event.\
         a. FOR CORE SAMPLES: Please download and use the [Sediment Core Sample Request Sheet](/Sample-Request-Form.xlsx) to detail the samples you are requesting.\
         b. FOR ROCK SAMPLES: Please download, fill out and submit the [Rock Sample Request Form](/Rock-Request-Form.xlsx) to detail the samples you are requesting.\
         i. *Note about Thin Sections*\
         Some samples contain a prepared petrographic thin section. These sections are available to borrow upon request. Given that high resolution plane-polarized and cross-polarized photos of these thin sections are already available in the OSU-MGR database, we ask that thin sections only be requested if SEM, EMP, FTIR or similar experiments are to be undertaken. Indicate if the thin sections will be coated and with what material in the sample request letter. We require that thin sections will be returned to the repository within two years or upon completion of the proposed research project.

      ***


      # 11. ARCHIVE HALF REQUESTS<Anchor value="archive" />


      Cores are split into two identical halves after retrieval, the working
      half and the archive half. While the working half is available for
      sampling to facilitate scientific objectives, the archive half is intended
      to remain as a pristine stratigraphic record of the material recovered.
      All the non-destructive analyses are usually made on the archive half
      (e.g. magnetic susceptibility, gamma ray density, line scan images,
      XRF-scans, CT-scans). Once the working half has been depleted, the archive
      half may need to be sampled. In these instances, a careful decision will
      be made by the repository staff to determine if the proposed science and
      sampling plan justifies sampling of the archive half of the core. In order
      to preserve the most complete record of the core the OSU-MGR requires that
      all non-destructive analysis must be completed on the section prior to
      sampling. Some of this is routine curation practice and has no cost to the
      person(s) requesting samples, others are not and will incur costs to the
      person(s) making the request.


      * MSCL data – if not already collected

      * Line Scan Image – routine curation

      * CT-Scan – charged to proponent

      * Itrax Core Scanner (image, x-radiograph, XRF) – charged to proponent


      This policy is expected to evolve as new techniques develop and become
      beneficial to the communities who work with OSU-MGR collections.


      ***


      # 12. APPROVAL OF REQUEST<Anchor value="approval" />


      Sample requests are forwarded to the curators for approval. In cases of
      conflict of interest,


      * Principal investigators who obtained materials are consulted to verify
      whether or not they are still working on requested materials.

      * Conflicts between different investigators requesting the same samples
      for the same purpose are mediated and resolved by consultation.

      * The MGR advisory committee will be consulted.


      ***


      # 13. SAMPLING<Anchor value="sampling" />


      The staff of the OSU-MGR will take the requested samples, or researchers
      may take their own samples under staff supervision. We request that
      researchers with large sample requests (>100) come to the repository to
      collect their samples.


      Samples will be taken so that a continuous vertical portion of the core
      remains in the work half whenever possible. In general, the archive half
      is reserved for non-destructive analyses in order to preserve the original
      stratigraphy of the core. (See "Archive Half Requests".)


      ***


      # 14. SAMPLE SHIPMENT<Anchor value="shipment" />


      The MGR pays for shipping of samples within the United States.
      International researchers should plan to submit a shipping account number
      prior to sampling.


      ***


      # 15. INSTRUMENTATION<Anchor value="instrumentation" />


      Users must be trained for use of OSU-MGR equipment by staff. Additional
      safety training may be required for use of an instrument via OSU EH\&S.
      Users are required to [pay for use of
      instrumentation](/facility-instrumentation) and associated technician time
      per current fee schedules available online at the repository's webpage.
      Users should let staff know if an instrument is not working properly or
      data quality is suspect.


      ***


      # 16. DATA AND SAMPLE MORATORIUM<Anchor value="moratorium" />


      The OSU-MGR adheres to the standard NSF [Sample and Data
      Policies](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/geo-data-policies/index.jsp).


      After a standard (two year) moratorium, all sample materials housed at
      OSU-MGR and data created at the facility will be made publically available
      to the Earth science community. Extensions of this moratorium period may
      be possible and can be requested by Principal Investigators via email to
      the relevant funding agency (cc'ing OSU-MGR). The sample collectors will
      have direct and sole access to those samples during a moratorium period.


      * Copies of all data generated in house on all accessioned samples will be
      retained and linked to the sample record in the repository's data
      management system. The standard 2-year moratorium applies to data
      collected in-house.

      * In addition to copies of associated publications related to samples
      collected from the OSU-MGR collections, copies of any analytical results
      (tabular data, and DOIs if available) generated from sampled core must be
      submitted to the MGR upon two years after the date of the sampling event.


      ***


      # 17. FACILITY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<Anchor value="acknowledgement" />


      * We request that the OSU-MGR be acknowledged as the source of the sample
      material and/or provider of related analytical data in any publication
      that contains results from studies of the collections. Use OSU-MGR sample
      identifiers, location, and sample depths so that future researchers will
      be able to locate materials for additional investigations.

      * By acceptance of these policies, users agree to the repository's policy
      on acknowledgement in, and notification of, publications related to work
      conducted here.

      * All lab users should acknowledge the facility in their publications and
      presentations. Including the facility in your acknowledgements helps to
      spread the word about our services, and is crucial to the continued
      funding of the program. When the results of an OSU-MGR assisted project
      are published in journals, book chapters, conference proceedings, or
      theses, we request that the manuscript include an acknowledgement similar
      to the following: **\[Cores are archived at / Samples provided by] Marine
      and Geology Repository, College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences,
      Oregon State University.**

      * In talks, we request an acknowledgement similar to the following:
      **Assistance provided by Marine and Geology Repository, Oregon State
      University.**

      * In addition, when a project is complete, we request that all users
      provide us with a copy (preferably pdf or other electronic format) of any
      resulting manuscripts, which we will keep for our records. This, too, is
      important for the continuation of our facility.

      * Users are also asked to consider including extensive assistance provided
      by facility staff in their acknowledgements.


      ***


      # 18. CURATORIAL ADVISORY BOARD<Anchor value="board" />


      Members of the advisory board provide input and oversight on policy
      development and implementation, direction of the repository, as well as
      general operational feedback. Specifically, the board may also provide
      guidance in the event of conflicting sample and/or data-related requests,
      archive half requests, moratorium inquiries, or deaccession efforts.


      The charge of this committee is to:


      * Establish long-term goals for the curation of the collections in the
      OSU-MGR.

      * Formulate policy recommendations and deaccessioning guidelines (if
      deemed necessary) for the OSU-MGR.

      * Make recommendations about allocating resources in support of the
      OSU-MGR mission.

      * Help promote and facilitate the use of the OSU-MGR facility in national
      and international science programs, facilities and meetings.

      * Encourage research, education and outreach efforts of the OSU-MGR.

      # 20. OUTREACH<Anchor value="outreach" />


      Outreach is an important part of what we do at the OSU-MGR. Educational
      visits (including K-12 field trips and OSU undergraduate/graduate labs)
      may be scheduled by request with the MGR staff subject to availability of
      the staff and facility. These visits typically include touring the
      facility as well as viewing representative cores. These representative
      "tour cores" have been chosen to show a variety of ocean sediments and
      must remain at the MGR to ensure proper care. The repository has [several
      outreach activities](/education-outreach) that may be used off-site,
      either by MGR staff or loaned out upon request for use in classrooms or at
      public events. Additionally, there are virtual online options on the MGR
      website that provide videos and core information for use when in-person
      visits are not possible.
