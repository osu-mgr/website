    body: "# <Superscript value=\"40\" />Ar/<Superscript value=\"39\" />Ar Geochronology Software\n\nSince 1998 Prof.\_[Anthony Koppers](http://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/profile/koppers/)\_has been actively working on his freeware\_[ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_software\_for\_<Superscript value=\"40\" />Ar/<Superscript value=\"39\" />Ar geochronology\_(Koppers 1998). \_In 2002 he published the first version\_(Koppers 2002) that now is used by dozens\_<Superscript value=\"40\" />Ar/<Superscript value=\"39\" />Ar\_laboratories world-wide. Since October 2005 NSF-EAR Instruments and Facilities has been sponsoring the further development of\_[ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_resulting in two\_major updates. Currently, Prof.\_[Koppers](http://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/profile/koppers/)\_and Dr.\_[Rupert Minnett](http://www.cogense.com/)\_are designing and programming\_[ArArSUITE](http://geochronology.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/software/#ArArSUITE)\_which constitutes a new set of software tools for the management of\_<Superscript value=\"40\" />Ar/<Superscript value=\"39\" />Ar geochronology experiments and carrying out data acquisitions.\n"

  - body: "## ArArCALC\n\n[ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_was initially developed at the Laboratory of Isotope Geology of the Free University in Amsterdam as part of the Ph.D. thesis of Anthony Koppers (Koppers 1998). The data reduction software for\_<Superscript value=\"40\" />Ar/<Superscript value=\"39\" />Ar geochronology was expanded while he worked at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. In 2002 the first version was published and became available to the international\_<Superscript value=\"40\" />Ar/<Superscript value=\"39\" />Ar community (Koppers 2002) and now is used by dozens of laboratories over the world. Since October 2005\_NSF-EAR Instruments and Facilities has been sponsoring the further development of\_[ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_resulting in two\_major updates. Since his arrival at Oregon State University in 2007, the\_[ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_software has been overhauled to include some long sought-after database functionalities to store J-values, standards run, air shot data, potassium salt, and fluorite data, and include input filters for multi-collector data files.\n\nThe program [ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_provides an interactive interface for data reduction in <Superscript value=\"40\" />Ar/<Superscript value=\"39\" />Ar\_geochronology. [ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_is coded within Visual Basic for Excel 2000-XP-2003-2007-2011 using datasheets, charts, menus, and dialog boxes. All <Superscript value=\"40\" />Ar/<Superscript value=\"39\" />Ar\_age calculations are reported in single Excel workbooks and thus can be easily shared between different [ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_users within and outside laboratories. All workbooks can be saved in various formats (Excel, PDF, XML) and/or using the standard community data format (Renne et al. 2009). Finally, all [ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_files and age data\_can be uploaded to the online data repositories of [GEOCRHON](http://www.geochronportal.org) and the [EarthRef.org Digital Archive (ERDA)](http://earthref.org/ERDA/).\n\n[ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_can be used online and offline during mass spectrometry and includes the following basic utilities:\n\n* Curved or linear data regression\n* Blank evolution analysis\n* Age calculation\n* J-value calculation\n* Air shot calculation\n* Age recalibration\n\nThese utilities fully interact with each other providing a high level of automation. [ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_also allows for editing of all input data, parameters, and constants used in the calculations at all times. [ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_can be run in the new file watch mode that allows auto- and batch-calculation of your mass spectrometer files.\_[ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_now also supports multi-collector files.\n"

  - body: "## ArArSUITE\n\nAs part of the final setup and automation of the new\_[ARGUS VI](/instruments/#ARGUS-VI) system a new software is being designed and programmed to allow for the 24/7 automated operation of the CO2 laser, the extraction line valves, and the multi-collector mass spectrometer. The new [ArArSUITE](/software/#ArArSUITE)\_software package will allow for:\n\n* Management of samples, irradiations and sample trays\n* Setup of total fusion, incremental heating and air shot (etc.) experiments\n* Flexible scheduling of multiple already-defined custom experiments\n* On-the-fly editing of heating schedules\n* Data acquisition using the ARGUS VI QTegra C# software environment\n* Generation of text format data files that can be automatically processed by [ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/)\_in its file watch mode\n\nThe [ArArSUITE](/software/#ArArSUITE)\_software package will be made available as freeware similar as [ArArCALC](http://earthref.org/ArArCALC/).\n"
