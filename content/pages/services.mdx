      Determinations Using ARGUS-VI


      ## Making Sample Dating Requests


      The [OSU Argon Geochronology Lab](http://osu-argon.org) carries out
      <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar analyses for
      researchers, post-docs, students and outside clients against a service fee
      as defined in the OSU Fee Book. If you are interested in getting your
      samples dated in our laboratory, download the **Sample Dating Request
      Spreadsheet** below, fill it out completely in Microsoft Excel, and email
      the forms to
      [geochronology@oregonstate.edu](mailto\:geochronology@oregonstate.edu).
      You can also contact us at
      [geochronology@oregonstate.edu](mailto\:geochronology@oregonstate.edu) to
      discuss your project and geochronology goals and to receive further
      instructions for completing the sample dating service request. Your
      samples to be-dated should be shipped to the address on the **[Contact
      Us](\contact-us)** page with a photocopy of the dating request spreadsheet
      inside each of the shipped boxes.

      **Geological Materials** that we can date, and pricing and typical
      turnaround times for the different level of services provided are
      indicated below. All experiments are carried out using **30W Synrad CO2
      Lasers** in a raster-scanning mode and the argon gas samples extracted are
      cleaned using customized **Thermo Scientific NG Prep Systems** and
      analyzed using one of two **Thermo Scientific ARGUS VI Multi-Collector
      Mass Spectrometers**.

      ## <Superscript value="40" />Ar/<Superscript value="39" />Ar  Age
      Determination via Bulk Incremental Heating


      Incremental heating for bulk mineral or groundmass samples ranging in
      weight from sub-milligram to maximally 40 mg of prepared material.
      Included in this service are up to 30 heating steps, up to 15 blanks,
      sample irradiation, flux monitor measurements, air short calibrations, and
      other related age standard measurements. A minimal data report, along with
      a description of our mineral separation protocol, acid leaching cleaning
      procedures, and mass spectrometry analyses will be included when the data
      is delivered via email. This service includes full mineral separation and
      acid leaching protocols.


      ## Total Fusion Age Determinations


      For total fusion experiments we apply the same service levels and
      turnaround times as listed in the table below. However, for single crystal
      studies requiring, for example, the dating of 100 single crystals per
      sample, the pricing is calculated as one standard service that covers 30x
      single fusions plus 70x additional fusions at $30 per fusion, totaling
      $3,400 per sample for an 8-12 month turnaround time. This service includes
      full mineral separation and acid leaching protocols.

      ## Other Services


      We also offer per-hour services that are in addition to the above standard
      services. These include additional or special mineral separation fees for
      more difficult samples or special projects, more in depth reporting,

      ## OSU TRIGA Irradiations


      Samples are neutron-irradiated at the [OSU Radiation
      Center](http://radiationcenter.oregonstate.edu/) in the **TRIGA**
      experimental reactor, typically at 1 MW power for periods that are optimal
      for the age and composition of samples being dated (typically from 1 to 12
      hours). The neutron fluxes during irradiation can be monitored with a
      variety of standard samples (Mmhb-1 hornblende, FCT-3 biotite, TCR
      sanidine) but we use **FCT-NM sanidine** as our default flux monitor.
      There are two different locations in the **TRIGA** reactor where samples
      can be irradiated and we use the Cd-shielded irradiation location
      **CLICIT** as our default as this is designed to block slow (thermal)
      neutrons in preference to fast neutrons. Irradiated materials are disposed
      through the [OSU Radiation Safety Office](http://oregonstate.edu/ehs/rso).
      All workers in our laboratory are trained in the safe handling of
      radioactive materials.
